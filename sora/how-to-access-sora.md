# How to Access Sora?

Sora is becoming available to red teamers to evaluate critical areas for potential harm or risk right now.

Introducing Sora, OpenAI text-to-video model. Sora is an AI model capable of generating realistic and imaginative scenes from text-based instructions. It can create videos up to one minute long, while maintaining visual quality and closely following the userâ€™s prompt.

Sora is being made accessible to red teamers to help identify risks and assess harm in critical areas. Additionally, we are providing access to a select group of visual artists, designers, and filmmakers to gather feedback on how to further improve the model for creative professionals.

We are sharing our research progress at an early stage to begin collaborating with and collecting input from individuals outside of OpenAI. This also allows the public to get a preview of upcoming AI capabilities.

At this point, we do not have a specific timeline or further details regarding Sora's wider public availability. Several crucial safety measures are in progress, including working with policymakers, educators, and artists worldwide to understand their concerns and identify positive applications for this technology. Stay tuned to our Twitter and website for future updates.
